            <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
            <p>Insect-based food has gained significant attention as a sustainable alternative to traditional protein sources. Here are some key points to consider: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High in Protein: Insects are rich in protein, often containing more protein per gram than beef or chicken</li>
                <li>Vitamins and Minerals: Many edible insects are good sources of vitamins (like B vitamins) and minerals (such as iron and zinc).</li>
                <li>Healthy Fats: Some insects contain beneficial fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="raj"> 
            <h2>Environment Sustainability </h2>
            <li>lower Carbon Footprint: Plant-based diets generally produce fewer greenhouse gases compared to meat-based diets.</li>
            <li>Conservation of Resources: Growing plants requires less water and land than raising livestock, making it a more resource-efficient option.</li>
            <li>Biodiversity Support: Emphasizing plant-based foods can promote sustainable agricultural practices that protect biodiversity.</li>
